The fastPerm package for R provides functions for quickly approximating small permutation p-values (e.g. p < 10^-6) for two-sample functions of the mean. It does this by partitioning the permutation space in such a way that there is a trend in the p-values across the partitions. It then calculates p-values in partitions that are cheap to evaluate, predicts p-values in partitions that are expensive to evaluate, and takes a weighted sum to get an overall p-value. A paper describing this method in more detail is currently under review. This approach can be faster than a current leading method -- stochastic approximation Monte Carlo -- which is also implemented in the fastPerm package.
