This R package provides functions for quickly approximating small permutation p-values (e.g. p < 10^-6). It does this by partitioning the permutation space in such a way that there is a trend in the p-values across the partitions. We then calculate p-values in partitions that are cheap to evaluate, predict p-values in partitions that are expensive to evaluate, and take a weighted sum to get an overall p-value. A paper describing this method in more detail is currently under review. This approach can be 10 times faster than a leading alternative method -- stochastic approximation Monte Carlo -- which is also implemented in the fastPerm package.
